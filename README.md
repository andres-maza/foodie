## Foodie

This is a web application created as my fourth project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. The application uses the navigator geolocation feature and alongise the OpenWeather API, it responds with food suggestions based on the current weather. The application then does a request to Yelp's api to serve a list of restaurants nearby the user matching the selected food term.
